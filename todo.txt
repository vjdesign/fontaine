The plan
--------

Issues
1. Old versions of WordPress (WP) and woocommerce (WC)
2. Theme not built using wp and wc way - code - there are no comments and no logical naming or structure
3. 37 active plugins - some of these haven't been updated in past 2 years (need to find alternatives)
4. Non-theme (i.e. plugin) functionality built into theme - built using PHPgrid which is not wp - https://wordpress.org/plugins/phpgrid/.

1. Build a light-weight responsive theme that works well with latest WordPress (WP) and woocommerce (WC)
2. Ensure that theme would be easy to upgrade inline with future upgrades to wp and wc
3. Build new templates to cater to new structure.
    Latest version of wc only has 4 pages:
    1. Shop
    2. Cart
    3. Checkout
    4. My Account
    We need to redirect lost pages to end-points
    https://docs.woothemes.com/document/woocommerce-endpoints-2-1/
    - Edit account page
    - Edit address page
    - Change password page
    - Lost password page
    - View order pages
    - Customer logout
    - Checkout pay page
    - Checkout thanks page
4. Ensure standard set up of new site works as before

the above does not include the below items where I need your help/clarity:

What I need - your help (James or someone who has been updating the contents)
-----------------------
Calculating shipping on a per product before adding to cart
What are your requirements?
What services are you using (bigpost, depots?)
Please explain how this works currently, and how you would like it to work?

On a per product basis:
What options do you set up, for example...
http://fontaineind.com.au/wp-admin/post.php?post=1168&action=edit

Can you please go through these backend menu items:
1. Shipping Admin
  - Cubic kg rate table
  - Product table
  - Post code table
  - Algorithm table
  - Warehouse cubic kg rate table
  - Warehouse pickup list
2. Calc. shipping

Do you use the above items? - these were custom developed (non-standard code - not wp)
How do you update (how frequently)?
Are any of these integrated with front-end site? or are they used purely by staff for calculations?
